# H21_project2_erlingpv_imadha
Project 2 for erlingpv (erlingpv@mail.uio.no) and imadha (imadha@mail.uio.no)



Part 1: Used VSC to build/compile into executable. In our understanding, we managed to complete the problem correctly. 
At least, it compiles and run, as well as providing promising and expected functionality/results. 
Perhaps code style could be better. Made test functions for the shrink-methods and 1e) which we call from the 'main' block. 
Besides that, we had some simple tests in main-block (just for us, since not asked for besides the aforementioned ones.) Furthermore,
we created a method 'int allocated()' which in some way return a private variable. To our understanding, this is not a prefered programming style, 
but we only used it for OUR testing purposes, hence we thought it was OK. A final remark is that we interpreted the
pop() method to delete the last element as well as returning it (as the word "delete" is not mentioned for this spesific method
we were not sure originally).
